# 👋 Hi, I'm Johnny


## 🎯 Cybersecurity Analyst in Training


The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive cybersecurity training environment that simulates a real enterprise network - complete with domain controller, executive/developer/user workstations, SIEM monitoring, and deliberately implemented vulnerabilities. It allows me to practice both attacking and defending systems using the same techniques that threat actors use in the wild, while mapping everything to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### 🛡️ Lab Development Timeline

This homelab follows a 5-phase development approach, progressing from foundational infrastructure through advanced purple team operations. Each phase builds upon the previous, demonstrating both offensive and defensive cybersecurity capabilities.

Each phase represents **simultaneous development** across three dimensions:

1. **🔧 Homelab Configuration**: Technical implementation and security scenarios
2. **📝 Content Creation**: Medium articles + GitHub repositories
3. **🌐 Website Development**: Portfolio pages showcasing each phase

#### 🔵 Phase 1: Vulnerable Foundation

**Building a deliberately vulnerable AD domain and network infrastructure across multiple layers**

Establishing an enterprise environment with intentional security weaknesses that mirror common real-world misconfigurations. Each vulnerability is deliberately introduced with documentation explaining its business justification, why it exists in real enterprises, and how it enables specific attack paths.

##### Lab Components

- Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller (DC01) with weak configurations
- Active Directory forest with over-privileged service accounts
- Intentionally misconfigured Group Policies enabling attack paths
- Disabled security controls simulating "business necessity" overrides
- Deliberately weak network segmentation

##### Tools & Technologies

- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell scripting and automation
- nmap
- Wireshark
- John the Ripper
- Hydra

#### Deliverables

- **Medium Articles**:
    - [Medium](https://medium.com/@johnnymeintel/list/vulnerable-infrastructure-251fa541c5ba)
- **GitHub Repositories**:
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/johnnymeintel/johnnycybersec/tree/main/01-phase-one-vulnerable-foundation)

**Value Proposition**: _Understand how enterprises actually get compromised and identify realistic security gaps_

---


#### 🔵 Phase 2: SIEM Implementation

**Deploying comprehensive security monitoring and threat detection capabilities**

[under construction]

**Value Proposition**: _Monitor, detect, and analyze security threats_

---


#### 🔴 Phase 3: Adversary Emulation

**Emulate a real adversary and follow a specific killchain to exploit the vulnerable environment. Treat this as a real penetration test**

[under construction]

**Value Proposition**: _Understand how systems get compromised and how to fix them_

---


#### 🟣 Phase 4: Detection & Remediation

**Mitigate the threat, remediate the compromised environment, and learn how to prevent future occurrences and increase response time**

[under construction]

**Value Proposition**: _Use attack methodology to build effective detection logic_

---


#### 🟣 Phase 5: Environment Expansion

**Advanced purple team operations and strategic security development**

[under construction]

**Value Proposition**: _Know how to lead security operations and drive strategic improvements_
